An 'Application Code Sample' - Provided as demonstration only - you are required to replace this with your own application.

There are 2 distinct code components to any deployment. These are:

  1. Infrastructure -  Can be virtualized, is consumed by codedeploy or etc., and is used to specify/define the infrastructure as code that the application runs on/in.
  2. Application - What this component is.

Use this Application Code Sample as a basic 'example' or demo application to push to your infrastructure so you can verify it is working.

This application represents a fully prepared deployment ready application typically served from a web root directory (path: /var/www/.) Commonly these files are written in HTML and contain index.html as the starting point (/var/www/index.html).

Typically this application is served up by your web server daemon (such as Apache or NGINX) to visitors to your web site.

This would be replaced by your own deployment ready application.
